//  Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would 
//you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. 
//Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

// Explain & TIP: Just like with transportation, you can use an array to manage a list of guests.
// Loop through the list to send each one a personal invitation.

let  Guest_List = ["Jame clear" , "Buddha" , "Aristotle" , "Shakespare"]
Guest_List.forEach(Guest_List => {
    console.log("Dear" ,`${[Guest_List]}`," We would be honored if you could join us for dinner at our home on [Date] at [Time]")
