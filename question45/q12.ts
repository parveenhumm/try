// Greetings: Use the array from Exercise 11.
// Instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them.
//  The message should be the same for each person, but personalized with their name.

// Explain & TIP: This builds on the previous exercise.
//  Now, you’re not just listing names, you’re using them in a sentence
//  to make a personalized message for each friend.


let names : string  [] = ["Humaira Parveen" , "Rimsha Mushtaque" , "Afifa Hussain" , "Rabeeha Zaki"];
let i :any = 0 ;
for(i=0 ; i<=3 ;   i++){
    // for loop to acess each element one by one
console.log("Hy! it's me " ,`${names[i]}`)}
