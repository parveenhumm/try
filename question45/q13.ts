// Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, 
// such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. 
// Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, 
// such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”

// Explain & TIP: Arrays help you group related items, like types of transportation. 
// This way, you can talk about each one using a loop.
 
let mode_of_tranportation = [ "streetcars" , "Ship" , "Bicycle" , "Motorbike" ,"Car"]
mode_of_tranportation.forEach(mode_of_tranportation=> {
    // visiting each item individually
    
console.log("I want to own", `${mode_of_tranportation}.`)
});
